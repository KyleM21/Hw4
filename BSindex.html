		<p>Welcome! Here is a little bit about me: <br>
		I am a Computer Science major who wishes to become a Software Engineer.  
		My hobbies are going to the gym and playing video games.  I haven't really
		done anything during my quarintine except schoolwork and occasionally a 
		video game.  Normally I try to do atleast one cool thing over the summer button
		with the whole Coronavirus pandemic I've elected to just stay home where it is
		safe and germ free. The most exciting thing I've done is get a lot of takeout
		food.<br><br><br>
		There was this really good sandwich I had recently and you can find my review of it here (This is also where you'll find the next part of homework 4): <br>
		</p>
