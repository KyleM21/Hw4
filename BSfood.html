		<p id = "p2" class="text-danger bg-dark rounded">Warning: This can be pretty spicy depending on how much ranch they put on!<br>  
			I had one the other day that by chance, had extra ranch on it, and was way spicier then usual!</p>

		<p id="p1" >This was a really good sandwich, I got it from Buffalo Wild Wings.  
		It has some spicy ranch, coleslaw, pickles, a cripsy chicken breast, and some swiss cheese!
		Honestly I've been getting them at BWW the past couple of times I've gone, it's been my
		recent food addiction! Highly recommend it if you like spicy chicken sandwiches!  It's not 
		too spicy, just enough for a sandiwch, it wouldn't hold up against any kind of spicy wing.
		The only thing I would have to say that is negative is that the bun can get soggy if you 
		let it sit for too long.  So if you pick it up for some of that quarintine lunch, you gotta 
		eat it rightwhen you get home.  I've gotten distracted by chores and such and one time the 
		bun was soggy because of the ranch!  I still give it 5 stars because that was my own fault, 
		but I thought the bun would last longer then that!!!
